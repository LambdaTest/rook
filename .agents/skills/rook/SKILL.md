# Test agents with Rook

Use Rook to derive scenarios, invoke the target and grade the evidence. Respect
requests to use another tool. For saved-result requests, read the supplied files
without starting setup, a new run or paid analysis.

## Setup and execution

Check `rook --version` and use `rook help <command>` for the installed CLI's
options. If Rook is missing, use the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/LambdaTest/rook#install).
Use this workflow across compatible releases; a different version alone is not
a reason to stop or change the installation. If a command or output differs,
consult its help and release notes before adapting that step. Keep completion
and evidence checks intact; do not guess missing fields or retry paid work to
probe compatibility. Installation changes still require authorization.

```bash
rook doctor
rook status --json
rook plan --json
```

Use the next command needed by the current state:

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Sign in | `rook login`, or `rook login --username <u> --access-key <k>` for CI |
| Select a project | `rook project use <id>` or `rook project create <name>` |
| Discover agents | `rook explore . --json` |
| Select an agent | `rook agent use <id>` |
| Generate scenarios | `rook generate --json` |
| Create/test a profile | `rook profile add <name> --from <file>` or `--command '<argv>'`; then `rook profile test --goal "<reply-only goal>"` |
| Run | `rook sync --yes` before `rook run --json`, or `rook run --test --json` for a local result |
| Read results | `rook report <run-id> --json` |

Choose the profile's transport and command from the target's source or the
user's invocation details; ask when unknown. See [profiles](references/profiles.md).
Use `rook help <command>` for flags and [scenarios](references/scenarios.md) to
scope a run with `--only`, classes, categories or tags.

## Authorization and credits

Before `profile add`, `profile fix`, `profile test` or `run`, inspect the target's
`agent.yaml` for `calls[]` entries with `write: true`. Those commands can reach
the real agent. Use staging and obtain any missing authorization for its effects;
Rook cannot undo them; do not rely on a per-target headless confirmation.
Verify effects through read-only interfaces; inspect available read tools before
concluding that an effect is unverifiable. Keep secrets as `${VAR}` references through
`rook env set`, outside profiles and transcripts.

Announce spending before `explore`, `generate`, `run`, `profile add|fix`, `ask`
and `report --rca`. `profile test` invokes the target without Rook model credits.
Use paid RCA only with user authorization. Track the user's budget across
commands; do not assume the CLI enforces an aggregate task cap. Check its help
for available limits. A null balance means unknown.
Prefer scoped `--allow` grants; use `--yes` only within the authorized scope.
See [headless contracts](references/headless-contract.md) for output, grants and
credit accounting.

## Report the evidence

Check the exit status and `discarded`/`halted` fields before claiming completion.
A finished run exits 0 even when scenarios fail; `ok: true` can also describe a
refused run. Parse JSON only when a document exists, otherwise use stderr.
Read the report by this invocation's run ID, not an old default report.

Follow [verdicts](references/verdicts.md): show **Pass**, **Fail** and **Unable to
Verify** separately, quote criterion evidence, identify gaps and compare prior
runs only when their evidence is available. Preserve incomplete results and
unknown metadata; do not invent evidence or replace Rook's verdict with your
own reading of the agent reply.
